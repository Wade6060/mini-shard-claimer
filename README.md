Before starting the soft, please set the requirements and fill in private;proxy.txt. The data in private;proxy.txt should look like private key;proxy(login:pass@ip:port)

If the transaction was successful, you can find its hash in hashes.txt

In case there are not enough funds in the wallet, or some error occurred, ERRORS.txt will be created, in which you will find the wallet, address, proxy, and the error that occurred when sending the transaction
